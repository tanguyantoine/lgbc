# Local Git Branch cleaner

I always end up with billions of local branches while developing.

Local Git Branch cleaner helps selecting and deleting local branches when not needed anymore

## Installation

```bash
yarn global add lgbc

# or

npm install -g lgbc
```

## Usage

```bash
lgbc

# or 

lgbc --cwd ../path/to/my-repo
```
